“Accelerating aquaculture development in Ghana through sustainable Nile Tilapia seed production and dissemination” 
TiSeed in short, the project was launched on February 19, 2019.  
The overall project seeks to improve productivity and profitability of tilapia cage and pond farming in Ghana. 

We first summarizes the (baseline) data collected from the census of active small tilapia farmers in four major 
producing regions: Ashanti, Brong Ahafo, Eastern and Volta. 

After the descriptive analysis, we will study the factors that affect fishing farming productivity and provide possible 
policy advices.
